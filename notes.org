* Game
** DONE One layer of blocks starts on the bottom
** Slowly more blocks start pushing in from the bottom, advancing up
** Instead of blocks, some are creatures
** If creatures are uncovered, they begin rushing towards you
** If creature reaches you, you die
** You can swipe up on uncovered block to move it to top side of screen
** You can swipe down to send a block back to the bottom (is sent in same row you swipe on)
** Three in a row of same color makes blocks/monsters disappear
** Monsters can chew through block in front of them
** Things gradually speed up as you kill more monsters
** If monster rushes at you and you send block on top of it, it stops in its tracks
** This goes on until you die
** Score is counted by number of ghosts killed
